# Model Memory Protocol (MMP) Documentation

## Overview
Model Memory Protocol (MMP) is a comprehensive protocol designed for LLM memory systems, taking inspiration from MCP and OpenTelemetry. It provides robust mechanisms for storing, retrieving, processing, and transporting memory events across large-scale AI systems.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Core source code for the protocol.
- **docs/**: Documentation, including guides and API references.
- **examples/**: Example applications showing how to use MMP.

## Key Features

1. **Memory Management**: Dynamic handling of multiple types of memory such as episodic, semantic, and procedural.
2. **Transport Mechanisms**: Supports WebSocket for real-time communication using JSON-RPC 2.0.
3. **Storage Tiers**: Integrates different storage backends like in-memory for fast access.
4. **Extensibility**: Easily extendable for additional storage or transport layers.

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
   ```bash
   git clone /home/forrest/Desktop/model-memory-protocol
   cd model-memory-protocol
   npm install
   ```

2. **Building**: Compile TypeScript to JavaScript.
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Running Tests**: Ensure all components are functioning correctly.
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Example Usage
Refer to the `examples/` directory for comprehensive usage examples, demonstrating integration with AI systems.
